#Learning Javascript

Learning Javascript and it's library, jQuery, is extremely daunting. I had previously
been introduced to HTML and CSS while learning front-end development using Code Academy
so it was completely new--I had zero experience. With Bloc, I began using Code School
to learn the beginning concepts and luckily, due to a previous class where I took
python I was able to decipher some of Javascript's code. As of now, I am still
learning Javascript and jQuery and it is still daunting. It is a language I will have
to be patient with and study A LOT but I know with more practice I will get better.


All in all, I have created a *fun* table displaying my perception of each coding
languages difficulty


| Language:    | Difficulty 1 - 100000 |
| HTML         | 38                    |
| CSS          | 166                   |
| Javascript   | *BAH*!11!!            |
| jQuery       | **50COOCOO00**        |


For some comic relief, below is a bit that describes how I fell about Javscript
sometimes:
