#My Experience at Bloc

Previous to my experience with Bloc, I had taken a front-end development course with Code Academy that gave me a foundation of both HTML and CSS. The course was also supposed to introduce Javascript, but to me it lacked incredibly. After the course with Code Academy, I realized I wanted to learn more front-end developing languages, with an emphasis in Javascript. As of now with Bloc I have learned what it takes to create a project from start to finish. I have also learned the complexity of Javascript and jQuery. In this experience both of my mentors have been incredibly patient and attentive and have been invaluable to me.
